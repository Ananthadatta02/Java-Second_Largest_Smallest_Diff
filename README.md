# Java-Second_Largest_Smallest_Diff
This Java program calculates the difference between the second largest and second smallest elements in an array. It takes user input for the array size and elements, sorts the array using a nested loop, and then finds the required difference. The program demonstrates array manipulation, sorting logic, and user interaction using Java.
